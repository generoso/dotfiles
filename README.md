# README

This is my `.dotfiles` project.

Your dotfiles define how you personalize your system.


## Getting started

```
git clone https://github.com/generoso/dotfiles.git
mv dotfiles $HOME/.dotfiles
cd $HOME/.dotfiles
./install
```

All the files in this repo whose name ends in `.symlink` will be symlinked to `$HOME`. 
All the files whose name ends in `.configlink` will be symlinked to `$HOME/.config/`.

## Credits

To start-up my `.dotfiles` I took as a model the awesome [mauriciojost/dotfiles](https://github.com/mauriciojost/dotfiles).
